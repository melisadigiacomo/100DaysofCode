![datavizcheatsheet](images/datavizcheatsheet.png)


## **Day 78** <a id="78"></a>

Lambda  
- Syntax: lambda arguments: expression
- Common use: one line of code functions or as an anonymous function inside another  
- Return a single result    
- Not necessarily associated with a function name  
- Always check whether or not is clearer than a regular funct


## **Day 79** <a id="79"></a>

Python LISTS:
- Store multiple values in one single variable
- Access elements by index
- len() method to return the length
- FOR loop to walk through all the elements
- List methods 

![listmethods](images/listmethods.png)

LIST vs ARRAY

Lists and arrays are used to store data and allow indexing, slicing and iteration. Both are ordered, mutable, enclosed in [] and able to store non-unique items.

- List: built-in data structure. Elements can be of different data types. Advantage: useful for short sequence of items without importing modules.  
- Array: data structure that must be declared by using array module (requires all elements to be of the same type) or NumPy package (support different data types). Advantage: arrays are more efficient for storing large amounts of data and handle better math operations.


## **Day 80** <a id="80"></a>

Object-oriented programming (OOP)

Programming paradigm based on the concept of OBJECTS, which can contain data and code: data as attributes/properties and code as methods. It focuses on creating reusable code.

- Python Objects and Classes
    - Create classes and objects  
    - __ init __ function  
    - Object Methods  
    - self parameter

![OOP-Python](images/OOP-Python.png)


## **Day 81** <a id="81"></a>

Object-oriented programming (OOP)

![congress](images/congress.gif)


## **Day 83** <a id="83"></a>

More Python:

- Exceptions types
- Handling exceptions: 
    - try/except
    - finally
    - raise
    - assertions


## **Day 84** <a id="84"></a>

Recursive function  
A function that calls itself.

- Base case: define one or more base cases that stop the recursion.
- Recursion case: make the recursive call.
- Convergence: the reduction made in the recursive case needs to converge to the base cases, so that the recursion ever ends.

# Final thoughts

- Community: I am so happy of the community I got to know thanks to the challenge. I learned a lot from everyone. They are all so supportive and are there to help anytime.  

- Constancy: It is a great way to keep constant. It really helps to self-motivation.  

- Progress: it documents your progress. Take time to think how much you have improve is awesome.  

- Resources: people share their roadmaps and resources. There's a lot to learn and as many are self-taughts, knowing where to start or following a plan helps a lot. I discovered bunch of cool stuff that I didn't know they existed.  

I 100% recommend this challenge! Take a day or more if you need to, but keep going, the results are allucinating! I will keep going myself and continuing to share with this amazing community. Thank you for making so far!
